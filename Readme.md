## what is this?
A particle life simulation that I'm working on.

Currently supports particle collision and reaction.

- Base class for particles.
- Base class for bonds
- Simple soft bodies can be simulated

Particles functionality can be expanded.

## How to build project
Currently no implementation build implementation, you will need Raylibs to build this project.

TODO: 
- add a cmake list
- Add a way to simulate muscle contractions with bonds
- Add a perception molecule
- chemical reactions
- Building molecules
- Universe constants
- Optimisation
